###Using test driven development, implement a Stack class that supports the following:
- capacity
- len()
- is_empty()
- push(value)
- pop()
- peek()
- find()

####Additionally, the following errors must be raised:
- Throw a Stack Overflow error if you try push pasts it's capacity.
- Throw a Stack Underflow error if you try pop an empty stack.
- Throw an Invalid Capacity if you try create a stack with a negative capacity.
- An empty Stack must either throw an Empty error or return None when you peek() into it.
- find() will return None or -1 when you try find a value in the stack that does not exist.
